# Metrics Dog Breeds
>The Metrics dog web app is a web platform that shows a variety of dog breeds and their skills.
API used for fetching data: TheDogApi
The app is fully mobile responsive and tested using Jest and the React Testing Library.
This is a capstone project for the React and Redux Module.

By building this application, I learned how to use React and Redux.
